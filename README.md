## Extensions

Quartz extensions install as a single `.qrx` package. A `.qrx` file is a ZIP archive containing a WebExtension `manifest.json` at its root, saved with the `.qrx` file extension.

Users can opt into extensions with **Extensions > Install .qrx Extension...** and choose a `.qrx` package. Quartz copies installed packages into Application Support and restores them on launch.

The former bundled ad-blocking filters now live in a separate Quartz Ad Blocker extension package.
