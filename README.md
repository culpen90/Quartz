- Basic keyboard menu items

## uBlock Origin integration

Quartz vendors the official uBlock Origin 1.71.0 Chromium release assets and compiles the compatible network-filter subset into `WKContentRuleList` rules at startup. The full uBlock Origin extension UI and dynamic filtering engine require browser extension APIs that are not available inside `WKWebView`, so Quartz uses the shipped filter assets natively instead.
